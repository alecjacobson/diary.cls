diary.cls
=========

LaTeX class for casual mathematical notes.

Here's an example:

```latex
\documentclass{diary}
\title{An example diary entry}
\author{Alec Jacobson}
\date{30 July 2015}

\begin{document}
This is an example diary entry. Notice that the title doesn't take up half of
the first page, and this single column has reasonable margins.
\end{document}
```
